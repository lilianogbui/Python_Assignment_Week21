This are basic python programming and how jupyter notebooks is used for data analysis.
some python basics used :[1]variables- it stores values in a named container,it can be reassigned or updated. [2] For loops- iterate over a sequence(e.g, list,string,range),it exeute a block of code for each item in the sequence. [3]nested for loops- a for loop inside another for loop,it used to iterate over multiple sequences or dimensions.[4]functios- reuseable blocks of code that performs a specific task,it can take arguments and return values.
pandas and numpy were introduced(a sample data was loaded).
